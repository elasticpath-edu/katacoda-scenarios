In this step, you will extend a core Flow `customers` to extend the Customer with a Field wishlists that will allow it to be connected to the custom resource `wishlists` from the previous exercise.

### Create Customers Flow

Check if you already have a Flow for the core resource `customer`.

* Open the collection in the editor
* Explore the `Get all fields on customer flow` request
* Send the request to get all fields on the `customers` flow, if it exists.

`newman run collection.json --folder "Get all fields on customer flow" -e environment.json --export-environment environment.json`{{execute}}

>If the `customers` flow already exists, it is returned. You should open the environment file and replace `null` to update environment variables named `customersFlowID` and `customersFlowSlug`.
`environmentcollectionen}}

If last command returned with `Flow not found` error, complete the following steps to extend the customers entity:

* Open the collection in the editor
* Open the `Create a customer flow` request and replace the contents in the `Body` section with:

<pre class="file" data-filename="collection.json" data-target="insert" data-marker="#CUST-FLOW-BODY">
{\"data\": {\"type\": \"flow\",\"name\": \"Customers\",\"slug\": \"customers\",\"description\": \"Extends the default customer object\",\"enabled\": true}}
</pre>
> Remove any extra line breaks inserted in the raw data above.
* Send the request to create a flow and return the flow ID and slug that will be saved in `customersFlowID` and `customersFlowSlug` environment variables by the test script.

`newman run collection.json --folcollectione a customer flow" -e environment.json --export-environment environment.json`{{execute}}

### Add Fields to the Customers Flow

Now, create a new Field of relationship type to link a customer to wishlists:

* Open the ccollectionin the editor
* Open the `Create a wishlist field` request and replace the contents in the `Body` section with:

<pre class="file" data-filename="collection.json" data-target="insert" data-marker="#WISH-FIELD-BODY">
{\"data\": {\"type\": \"field\",\"name\": \"Wishlists\", \"slug\": \"wishlists\", \"field_type\": \"relationship\", \"validation_rules\": [{\"type\": \"one-to-many\",\"to\": \"wishlists\"}], \"description\": \"Customers wishlists\", \"unique\": false,\"enabled\": true, \"required\": false,\"relationships\": {\"flow\": {\"data\": {\"type\": \"flow\", \"id\": \"{{customersFlowID}}\"}}}}}
</pre>
> Remove any extra line breaks inserted in the raw data above.
* Send the request to create a field and return the field ID and the field slug that will be saved in `wishlistFieldID` and `wishlistFieldSlug`  environment variables respectively by the test script.

`newman run collection.json --folder "Create a wishlist field" -e environment.json --export-environment environment.json`{{execute}}

### Create a New Customer

* Open the collection in the editor
* Open the `Create a customer` request and replace the data in the `Body` section with **your info**
* Send the request to create a customer and save the customer ID in the environment variable `customerID`:

`newman run collection.json --folder "Create a customer" -e environment.json --export-environment environment.json`{{execute}}


### Get a Customer's Wishlist

Now, that youâ€™ve added a `wishlists` Field to the customer resource, when you make the API call to get a customer, you must see the wishlist(s) directly on the customer data object.

* Send collectionll customers` request to get the customer.

`newman run collection.json --folder "Get all customers" -e environment.json --export-environment environment.json`{{execute}}

> Wishlist Field must have `null` as the value. Don't worry, you will create entries in the next exercise.collectioncollection
